This repository provides the codes to estimate the local covariate-specific treatment effect (LCSTE) under high-dimensional data, based on the methods proposed in the paper "Inference for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Observational Data with High-Dimensional Covariates" by Yumou Qiu, Jing Tao and Xiao-Hua Zhou.

The function **TwoStageReg.Proposed()** in the file **functions.txt** provides the code for the proposed method. The other two functions *TwoStageReg.Unweighted.Lasso* and *DML* are for two existing methods used in the paper for comparison.
